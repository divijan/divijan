- 👋 Hi, I’m @divijan
- I am primarily a Scala developer
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development, functional programming and ways to automate mundane and repetitive tasks (e.g., DevOps tools)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to deal with effects and I/O in functional programming with the help of Functional Programming in Scala book (aka "The Red Book")
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some tool that automates something that many people do and that haven't been automated yet
- 📫 How to reach me: my skype handle is yar.ilich
